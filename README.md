# opentracing-java-demo
Demo apps using Spring Boot and Sparkjava with Docker using Opentracing with Jaeger

The Spring Boot members app calls the Sparkjava vhs-catalog service to look up movie names rented by the customer.

Build both projects using gradle, then build docker containers. See build.sh and run.sh for examples.
